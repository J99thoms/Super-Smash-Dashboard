# The Super Smash Dashboard

Welcome to The Super Smash Dashboard! This is a resource for Super Smash Bros. players who are interested in exploring the various quantitative attributes that control a character's in-game physics, such a character's weight, a character's maximum movement speed (in various forms, e.g. walking, running, and airborne), and a character's airborne acceleration.


## Proposal

I ([@J99thoms](https://github.com/J99thoms)) am a graduate student at the University of British Columbia who is enrolled in their Master of Data Science program (UBC MDS). I am also a huge fan of Super Smash Bros. As a result, The Super Smash Dashboard was created as both a personal project as well as to satisfiy part of the requirements of the UBC MDS program. The project proposal can be found [here](proposal.md).

## Usage

With this dashboard, users are able to choose which attributes to visualize as well as how to visualize those attributes. Users can quickly see which characters have the highest/lowest value in any given attribute by using a bar chart, and can also see how any given attribute relates to any other attribute by using a scatter plot. The visualizations include tooltips so that one is able to determine the exact values of a character's attributes by simply hovering their mouse over the relevant section of the visualization.
